title: Execution Workspaces And Runtime Services
summary: How project runtime configuration, execution workspaces, and issue runs fit together
---

This guide documents the intended runtime model for projects, execution workspaces, and issue runs in Paperclip.

Paperclip now presents this as a workspace-command model:

- `Services` are long-running commands that stay supervised.
- `Jobs` are one-shot commands that run once and exit.
- Raw runtime JSON is still available for advanced config, but it is no longer the primary mental model.

## Project runtime configuration

You can define how to run a project on the project workspace itself.

- Project workspace runtime config describes the services and jobs available for that project checkout.
- This is the default runtime configuration that child execution workspaces may inherit.
- Defining the config does not start anything by itself.

## Manual runtime control

Workspace commands are manually controlled from the UI.

- Project workspace services are started and stopped from the project workspace UI, and project jobs can be run on demand there.
- Execution workspace services are started and stopped from the execution workspace UI, and execution-workspace jobs can be run on demand there.
- Paperclip does not automatically start or stop these workspace services as part of issue execution.
- Paperclip also does not automatically restart workspace services on server boot.

## Execution workspace inheritance

Execution workspaces isolate code and runtime state from the project primary workspace.

- An isolated execution workspace has its own checkout path, branch, and local runtime instance.
- The runtime configuration may inherit from the linked project workspace by default.
- The execution workspace may override that runtime configuration with its own workspace-specific settings.
- The inherited configuration answers "which commands exist and how to run them", but any running service process is still specific to that execution workspace.

## Issues and execution workspaces

Issues are attached to execution workspace behavior, not to automatic runtime management.

- An issue may create a new execution workspace when you choose an isolated workspace mode.
- An issue may reuse an existing execution workspace when you choose reuse.
- Multiple issues may intentionally share one execution workspace so they can work against the same branch and running runtime services.
- Assigning or running an issue does not automatically start or stop workspace services for that workspace.

## Execution workspace lifecycle

Execution workspaces are durable until a human closes them.

- The UI can archive an execution workspace.
- Closing an execution workspace stops its runtime services and cleans up its workspace artifacts when allowed.
- Shared workspaces that point at the project primary checkout are treated more conservatively during cleanup than disposable isolated workspaces.

## Generated dependency cleanup

Local Paperclip instances can accumulate large generated dependency and build directories across isolated worktrees. Operators can audit this disk pressure without removing worktrees or branches:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai worktree:clean-generated
```

The command is dry-run by default and only targets allowlisted generated directories such as `node_modules`, `dist`, `.next`, `.vite`, `.turbo`, and common cache directories. A directory is eligible only when the worktree is clean, live process inspection confirms no running process is using it as a current directory, the directory is older than the configured threshold, git ignores it, and no tracked files exist underneath it. If live process inspection is unavailable, the command skips the worktree and reports the reason.

Apply the reported plan with:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai worktree:clean-generated --apply
```

This cleanup path is intentionally narrower than execution-workspace archival. It does not delete source files, git metadata, branches, run logs, backups, secrets, databases, or Paperclip instance data.

To compare reclaimable generated artifacts against fully retireable execution workspaces before deleting anything, run:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai workspace cleanup-inventory --company-id <company-id>
```

That report uses the same generated-cleanup checks as `worktree:clean-generated` plus the execution-workspace close-readiness policy, so operators can distinguish "safe to reclaim caches/build outputs" from "safe to retire the whole worktree" without re-checking git status, linked issues, or finalize proof by hand.

## Resolved workspace logic during heartbeat runs

Heartbeat still resolves a workspace for the run, but that is about code location and session continuity, not runtime-service control.

1. Heartbeat resolves a base workspace for the run.
2. Paperclip realizes the effective execution workspace, including creating or reusing a worktree when needed.
3. Paperclip persists execution-workspace metadata such as paths, refs, and provisioning settings.
4. Heartbeat passes the resolved code workspace to the agent run.
5. Workspace runtime services remain manual UI-managed controls rather than automatic heartbeat-managed services.

## Cross-run persistence (no-remote-git contract)

Code state moves between runs through the local execution-workspace cwd alone — not through a git remote.

- Each run's prepare step bundles the local worktree to the run's remote dir over ssh, with no `git remote` configured.
- The adapter's restore step at the end of the run writes any new remote commits back into the local worktree directly.
- Adapters must never `git push` from runtime code, and must never assume a remote exists.
- A failed restore is a run-level error and records `workspace_finalize=failed` on the execution workspace, which gates dependent issue wakes until the next successful finalize.

The invariant is enforced by the "no-remote-git contract" case in `packages/adapter-utils/src/ssh-fixture.test.ts`, which asserts a remote-only commit reaches the local worktree with no remote configured at any point.

## Current implementation guarantees

With the current implementation:

- Project workspace command config is the fallback for execution workspace UI controls.
- Execution workspace runtime overrides are stored on the execution workspace.
- Heartbeat runs do not auto-start workspace services.
- Server startup does not auto-restart workspace services.
