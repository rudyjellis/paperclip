title: Local Development
summary: Set up Paperclip for local development
---

Run Paperclip locally with zero external dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+

## Start Dev Server

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- **API server** at `http://localhost:3100`
- **UI** served by the API server in dev middleware mode (same origin)

No Docker or external database required. Paperclip uses embedded PostgreSQL automatically.

## One-Command Bootstrap

For a first-time install:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai run
```

This does:

1. Auto-onboards if config is missing
2. Runs `paperclipai doctor` with repair enabled
3. Starts the server when checks pass

## Fork-only Paperclip Workspaces

Diger Studios' Paperclip control-plane workspace must target the fork at `https://github.com/rudyjellis/paperclip.git`. Keep the Paperclip project workspace `repoUrl`, local `origin`, and default push target pointed at that fork so agent checkouts, pushes, and PRs do not target `paperclipai/paperclip`.

Represent upstream coordination as internal Paperclip issues first. Agents should not fetch from, push to, retarget, close, or make GitHub API requests against `paperclipai/paperclip` unless a human-approved owner explicitly routes that work.

## Bind Presets In Dev

Default `pnpm dev` stays in `local_trusted` with loopback-only binding.

To open Paperclip to a private network with login enabled:

```sh
pnpm dev --bind lan
```

For Tailscale-only binding on a detected tailnet address:

```sh
pnpm dev --bind tailnet
```

Legacy aliases still work and map to the older broad private-network behavior:

```sh
pnpm dev --tailscale-auth
pnpm dev --authenticated-private
```

Allow additional private hostnames:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname dotta-macbook-pro
```

For full setup and troubleshooting, see [Tailscale Private Access](/deploy/tailscale-private-access).

## Health Checks

```sh
curl http://localhost:3100/api/health
# -> {"status":"ok"}

curl http://localhost:3100/api/companies
# -> []
```

## Reset Dev Data

To wipe local data and start fresh:

```sh
rm -rf ~/.paperclip/instances/default/db
pnpm dev
```

## Data Locations

| Data | Path |
|------|------|
| Config | `~/.paperclip/instances/default/config.json` |
| Database | `~/.paperclip/instances/default/db` |
| Storage | `~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/storage` |
| Secrets key | `~/.paperclip/instances/default/secrets/master.key` |
| Logs | `~/.paperclip/instances/default/logs` |

Override with environment variables:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_HOME=/custom/path PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID=dev pnpm paperclipai run
```
